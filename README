First see if a binary is available otherwise:

For windows:
To compile a new binary "double click" setup.py (assumes a suitable compiler is available and that swig is installed)
binary (ReadIM[version,platform,python version].exe) can then be run from the dist folder.

Other platforms (untested):
setup.py may otherwise be used as normal:

e.g.
>>>python setup.py build install
