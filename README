Overview
========
ReadIM is a c++ wrapper to load DaVis Images and Vectors.
ReadIM is a 'low level' interface to C++ libraries provided by LaVision GMBH.

Installation
============
The libraries have been compiled succesfully on Windows platforms with 64-bit and 32-bit python.
The 64-bit version was complied using an Enthought distribution.
The 32-bit version was compiled using a python-xy distribution.

Linux versions appear incompatible at this stage.

You may attempt to compile your own version provided you have an appropriate
compiler and SWIG installed.

Only recommended for advanced users.

>>> python setup.py build install


Usage
=====

To load a .vc7 file run::

    >>> vbuff, vatts   =  ReadIM.extra.get_Buffer_andAttributeList('filename.vc7')
    >>> v_array, vbuff = ReadIM.extra.buffer_as_array(vbuff)

similarly for a .im7 file run::

    >>> vbuff, vatts   =  ReadIM.extra.get_Buffer_andAttributeList('filename.im7')
    >>> v_array, vbuff = ReadIM.extra.buffer_as_array(vbuff)
